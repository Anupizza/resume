  <p>HEYY! I am Anukriti . A girl full of big dreams and hopes. I wanted to be a doctor initially 
    so i gave neet (a total of 3 attempts)but unfortunately couldn't make it. so this was the first time i hit the failure. i joined a bachelor's degree in computer science and started pursuing it half heartedly 
    i learned a little bit of dsa (c++) and now i have decided to build up on my skills . so here i am learning web development.<br/>
